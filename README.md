# Crash Course Firebase 9

In this project I tried to update my knowledge about Firebase. Firebase is a platform that allows you to build web and mobile applications quickly and easily. Firebase provides various features that help you build applications, such as database, authentication, hosting, and many more. Firebase also provides SDK for various platforms, such as Android, iOS, and web.

The previous version I learned was version 8.x and this time I tried to learn version 9.x. Version 9.x has some significant changes, such as removing some features, adding new features, and changing the way to use existing features.

## Environment
